The Team: Sophia Chen, Jack Walton, Reena Zhang, Alice Qiao

About: This project is an artistic scheduler for VIVID, Vanderbilt's premier KPOP dance group. It will display a timeline with details for each project to help VIVID's artistic members to keep track of what they're working on. Artistic team members are those who work on the production side of videos, such as editing and filming. 

Framework: Our system archicture will model the MeanStack. Our front end will be written with the Angular framework.
